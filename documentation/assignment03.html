                        Our project explores communication as a material and embodied process by treating clay as an
                        active participant in a networked exchange. We built two “electronic beings” around clay, each
                        equipped with sensors that define its unique worldview. One side perceives weight, using a load
                        cell to sense the presence and pressure of clay; the other perceives moisture, using a humidity
                        sensor to register changes in the clay’s condition.
                        <br><br>
                        These two systems communicate through Adafruit IO. When clay is placed on the weighing sensor,
                        the weight data is uploaded and transmitted across the network, triggering an LED response on
                        the other side. In return, when water is added and the clay reaches a certain humidity
                        threshold, that data is sent back, activating a servo motor that begins to rotate—symbolizing
                        the start of the throwing wheel.
                        <br><br>
                        Rather than exchanging human-readable language, the two systems communicate through translated
                        material states: pressure becomes light, moisture becomes motion. This closed, internally
                        coherent system demonstrates how meaning can emerge from sensor data, encoding and decoding
                        environmental conditions into actions that only fully make sense within the logic of the system
                        itself.

                    <p class="p">
                        This project explores communication as a material and posthuman process by constructing two
                        electronic beings whose understanding of the world is defined by what they can sense. Built
                        around clay, one system perceives weight and pressure, while the other perceives moisture and
                        humidity. These sensory readings are transmitted through a shared network, where data is
                        encoded, exchanged, and decoded into physical responses—light and motion—forming a closed loop
                        of communication. Rather than using human-readable language, the systems communicate through
                        translated material states, where changes in clay become meaningful signals within the system
                        itself. Clay is treated not as a passive medium but as an active participant whose physical
                        conditions directly shape the behavior of the network. In this way, the project reimagines
                        communication and archiving as a live, relational process, where meaning emerges through
                        continuous sensing, translation, and response rather than static representation.

                        I was responsible for the weight-sensing system in the project. When I received the weight
                        sensor, I found that it required a load cell amplifier (HX711) to function properly. Before any
                        testing could take place, I first soldered the load cell wires to the HX711 amplifier, ensuring
                        stable electrical connections. This step allowed the raw analog signals from the load cell to be
                        amplified and read by the microcontroller, forming the foundation for weight detection and data
                        transmission in the system.

                        This was my first time attempting soldering, so the connections were not very stable at first. I
                        reinforced the joints twice to improve reliability. For my next iteration, I plan to use pin
                        headers (male pins with female jumper wires) instead, which will make the connections more
                        stable and easier to modify.

                        we initially failed to receive data from the other system.
